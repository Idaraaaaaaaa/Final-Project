# Final-Project
## Overview:
The project focuses on sentiment analysis of the Yelp reviews database. Yelp is a popular online platform where users can rate and review businesses. A typical Yelp review includes a star rating (from one to five stars) and a written review detailing the user's personal experiences, opinions, and comments about the business. With over 199 million reviews of businesses worldwide, there's a wealth of information to explore.

The goal is to see how analytics can help businesses make better decisions based on customer feedback. This will be done using text analytics, which can extract meaningful insights from the vast amounts of written reviews. These insights can help businesses understand customer opinions and make informed decisions to improve their services and products.
