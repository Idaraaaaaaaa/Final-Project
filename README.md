# Final-Project
## Overview:
The project focuses on sentiment analysis of the Yelp reviews database. Yelp is a popular online platform where users can rate and review businesses. A typical Yelp review includes a star rating (from one to five stars) and a written review detailing the user's personal experiences, opinions, and comments about the business. With over 199 million reviews of businesses worldwide, there's a wealth of information to explore.

The goal is to see how analytics can help businesses make better decisions based on customer feedback. This will be done using text analytics, which can extract meaningful insights from the vast amounts of written reviews. These insights can help businesses understand customer opinions and make informed decisions to improve their services and products.

I'll start by building a sentiment classifier using a decision tree model and then move on to more advanced models like random forests. Once the classifier is trained, it can be used to analyze sentiment in other online reviews that don't have a star rating.

To test the model, I'll use my HTML and CSS skills to create a simple Flask app where I can run predictions with the classifier.
